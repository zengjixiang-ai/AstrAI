# Contributing to AstrAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides step-by-step guidelines.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViperEkura/AstrAI.git
cd AstrAI
pip install -e ".[dev]"     # install with dev dependencies (pytest, ruff)
```

## Before You Commit

Run the following checks **in order** — CI will reject if any fail.

### 1. Format

```bash
ruff format .
```

> **Note**: `ruff format` may rename parameters (e.g. `mask` → `attn_mask`).  
> Always review the diff after formatting.

### 2. Import sorting

```bash
ruff check . --select I
```

If this fails, **manually fix** import ordering (ruff does not auto-fix in this project's CI):

```bash
ruff check . --select I --fix .
ruff format .    # re-format after fix
```

### 3. Run tests

```bash
python -u -m pytest tests/ -v
```

> Failed tests may leave orphan tempdirs under `%TEMP%`. Clean them manually if needed.

### 4. (Optional) Full pre-commit check

If you have Git Bash available:

```bash
bash scripts/pre_commit.sh
```

This runs format check, import sort check, and tests in one go.

## Commit Style

```
fix/feat/chore/docs/refactor/perf/test/style/ci/build/revert : short description (~50 chars)

- bullet point body (each ~60 chars)
```

- **Type** must be one of: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `style`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`.
- **Subject line** ends with no period.
- **Body** uses bullet points starting with `-`.
- No `(scope)` parentheses.

## Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `ruff check --select I` fails | Wrong import order | `ruff check . --select I --fix .` then `ruff format .` |
| `ruff format` changed many files | Not formatted before commit | Review diff carefully before staging |
| Pre-commit hook rejects | Tests or lint failed | Fix individually, do not `--no-verify` |
| Tests fail with tempdir left | Test crash | Clean `%TEMP%` manually |

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Make changes following the steps above.
4. Commit with the commit style above.
5. Push: `git push origin feat/my-feature`
6. Open a Pull Request against `main`.

## Code Review

- All PRs are reviewed. We may request changes.
- CI runs `ruff format --check .` then `ruff check . --select I` (no `--fix` in CI).
- Ensure all tests pass.
